# clown browser
## Intro
A web browser for clowns. A passion project of mine, may be useful for something. Is just a simple work in progress command line web browser. I might make a GUI GTK or Iced port in future if I get around to it.
## The Circus Web Engine
Clown Browser makes use of the Circus Web Engine, which is the component that renders the HTML on your computer.
